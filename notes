==================================================
;GLOSSARY

vnode - a data structure that corresponds to a DOM element (or a component?) 
component - 
rendering -
signal - 
diffing -
bubbling -

is glossary even that useful?
  it probably is if ambiguities occur

==================================================
;WHY?


I wanna have cool demos 
So in vanilla JS you can modify DOM

==================================================
;SIGNAL ARCHITECTURE

force update argument

signal subscribtion as decorator?

vnode as publisher to its children
  but vnode has be rendered too
    signals with side effects?
      isn't that overcomplicated?

explicit signal call

==================================================
;VIEW-MODEL ARCHITECTURE

seems meh for small state like togglable tree views
  is there a good way to solve this?

counter instead of queue?


[TODO]
to make it strictly VM, render sets up message queue 
  can't it just dispatch an event?
    not quite?
    test how events work

==================================================
;BROWSER STUFF

events
  events are for doing stuff after thing that's done now finishes
    rly?
  bubbling
    dispatching the same event to the parent?

event vs 

what are workers anyway?
  what can be done with them better?

setting attribs like normal object properties?

what's style recomputation anyway
how is it different from layout

or write a browser!
it's just text and boxes


==================================================
;SMALL DOM LIBRARIES

=========================
;LITTLE-VDOM


how it deals with state and update
  line 35
    no, it deals with components here
what's "&&" for in line 11


diffing props
  doesn't preact do it too?
    I thought it diffed the vnodes
      based on my experiment with preact

why are children added to props?
  you can change the component's children and it should update
  the children are rendered before it

other vdoms seemed to have a commit queue

why it appends to dom the way it does?

do fragments add anything to dom here?

line 20 - does this do anything?

does it work with numbers, etc?
  yes, it does

doesn't it do way too many dom updates?

are invisible dom attachments cheap?
  benchmark
    attach and detach node invisibly 

does replaceChildren delete the replaced?

=========================
;HUNDRED

no components?
  in elm components are just functions


==================================================
;BENCHMARK

[describe why the benchmark is what it is]
  even, odd
    all node state transitions 
  400 table cell changes
  list of elements that expands and shrinks

==================================================
;COMPONENTS

with expanding components there would be more vnodes than dom elements
why make component-vnodes?
  state and stuff

handling fragments within fragments

==================================================
;UNCATEGORIZED

multi-root version?

factor out dom changes?

empty component result?
  not possible here

maybe components follow as a nice memoization abstraction
  why would I call functions when I can call components which diff stuff and are faster?
  but why then would preact evaluate each component?
    shallow predicates?
      read the source

components as decorated functions?
  props without redundant naming

implicit memoization
  diffing all args
    but lists are different each time

maybe explicit memoization is better than implicit
because I have to know what I'm diffing

more vnode aware?

stuff like "effect" hooks?

can refs in my temperature converter be replaced with e.target?

keyed ast

"keylist" abstract nodes
  in current impl a concrete element must be bound

keys and stuff
  moving a tree

lazy tree diffing
  component nodes get expanded during diffing
does it have to mutate the tree?
  yeah, the results have to be diffed too
  but the combinatorial explosion doesn't happen, because the components are expanded first
    'diff' is called recursively until the node is a non-component
^^splitting expansion and diffing?


['mem', (list of values to check), expression]
  but this would eval
['mem', (list of values to check), function]

mem as a prop
  simpler to implement
mem as a tag
  much nicer
  generalizes to other abstract vnodes
  can be named like '!tag' or something
mem as "component"
  less verbose
  doesn't generalize as well

mem expr gets parsed differently
  

the deal with components
  storing stuff in the vdom tree

generalizing the vdom?
  stuff that does stuff when props change

separate component nodes?

components don't have to have children

memoization by default
  [fun, ...args]
  very lisp-like

doesn't adding components add like 5 more transitions?
  no, the component evaluation returns a vnode, you could just eval it
  where is the memo data stored? in the returned vnode?
    yeah:
      diff args
      if changed, eval
      write into the returned node props

solution to the shifty knob problem using memoization

what are components anyway


adding bounds to a knob

isn't that ridiculous how much computation is spent (or wasted) on rendering a simple knob turn?

normalizing the reading?

knob.display(param)
knob.display

interface for pushing and pulling from arbitrary widgets to params?
  param as an object
  param as a value in a model

just write a class?

test case
  a filter knob that can be both linear and logarithmic

knob's angle is always dependent on the parameter and the settings

knob
  title
  param
  setfun
  getfun
  units

knobs having a reference to the param, 

I want the toggled value to be separate from the widget
maybe knobs shouldn't be in the model?

how does V8 take care of the closures?
  does it recompile them whenever the enclosed variable change? I hope not! that would be stupid 
  look up how they are represented

widgets referencing the model

"draw" as a return value from init

no model
  

"draw" as a parameter or a global?
  global
  parameter

not bothering to diff invisible

https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/byalpha.html

maybe it would be better to copy index.html into each of the alternative repos
maybe it would be even better to write that weird bash script that commits the notes to all branches...

so it's much easier to think what is the document we want rather than
how to get from whatever the document might be at the time to the document at the time

global model might be ugly

updateKnob?

getting rid of the update function adds complexity
  message passing allows for additional logic such as stuff to be done for a group of messages
    the case I had for this proved to be unnecessary
  ^^ that's unnecessary

init:
  set the model
  bind the view

however it would be kinda nice if the model was to be explicitly passed as an argument

even more AIP way would be to export the model
  there's only one model anyway!
  you just set the model, bind the view and go
  you'll always be binding document.body, so render can be 0-adic
    
diffing anonymous functions
  - they're already diffed the right way
    not quite, if they just defer computation the result is a different function
  - ignore it
    but the closures should update!
      rly?
        yeah! they're closures. If the variable they closure over changes, they have to change
  - stringify if anonymous
    different closures have the same stringification

a fucktonobigclosures?
  maybe they're not that big
  just pull them out

a scope where stuff can only be mutated in closures

AIP way
  pass a message with the object reference
  mutate it
  profit?
but why not mutate it right away and tell the thing to update itself?
  because stuff is likely to be still rendering
    no, it's not?

risk of sneaky mutation?
  try to write something larger immutably and then try to write it as easy as possible 
    that's topsy-turvy
      AIP for the win
      you won't see if the risk in the dangerous version exists while doing it the safe way
    why did I think like that?
      maybe because that way I would have something that works when stuff breaks?


a tree of knobs
   
challenges of VM architecture
  wiring


stuff like that ain't fun
I can't write code that I would feel good about, because the problem is fundamentally shit
  it wasn't that hard though!

SVG 
  can svg stuff have 'onstuff' properties?
  vnode
    isSVG field
    initialized using isInSVG arg


knobs 'n stuff
  null namespace for attribs
    that's because 
  can an empty namespace be used for plain html
    if not, can I use a html namespace?


I've accidentally written a framework

update(model, subject, message)
update(model, header, message)
update(model, action, message) **

maybe the whole messages instead of functions thingy deserves a writeup

or maybe single-arg messages are ugly
  this too

initializing with a message is ugly after all
  returning initial state pro forma just sticks out before the common logic for other messages

elm is bloated
  wiring everything sucks
  duplication of closed functionality
    nah? you just do it in the model


memoization
  memo tag
  memo prop
  function tag

each message forces an update
  yay
    no need for pro forma state object update after a mutation
  nay
    diffing occurs when a do-nothing message gets sent
      but do nothing messages shouldn't be sent anyway

lispier expression syntax?

initializing with 'init' message

even in imperative version, where 'state' is a mutable variable, 'view' and 'update' must be
parametrized with 'state' and 'send', because they will be callbacks

the radical functional version passes 'send' to the view, because 'send' is a closure around immutable state
  no, it isn't
    it just passes 'send', because it's not in the scope where the view expression is compiled
    - well, can always export 'send'
    nah, it would be stupd, you don't use it 
  yes, it is
    how do you get send to change?
  fukit, let's do it imperatively first

messages are better than procedure calls, because procedure calls would have to be wrapped with update logic 

inline vs block display - layout recomputation time


inserting stuff before other stuff sounds like a way for layout recomputation

does it work for svg too?

okay, what now
  - move to another repo
  - refactor
      need a fresh eye
  - write a sensible interface
    'send' pseudotag
      so I can finally stop writing javascript
      but I will be sending state, not view
  - compare to react/preact




there's a weird clunk
  can't have a list that starts with a text node

but first, write a better benchmark
  or rather, just write something interesting until it's laggy
    pzaz
  this is a good benchmark though
    - table elements shouldn't change
    
problem with diffing children
  children list is a different object each time the tree is generated

turn the tag into a list and those are the children

string -> tag
array -> list of tags

now another mind blowing insight
html should be just lists


the stupidest way to do it is just returning strings and parsing it all as HTML at the end
like it's PHP




the bug
  happens when a text node gets replaced by a tag
  period 4 behavior ???
  solution
    element.replaceWith() only fiddles with the element's parent
    it doesn't mutate the element,
    it doesn't return anything

can use cases for keys be avoided by wrapping stuff in spans?

deleting orphaned nodes
  for now just delete nodes above the new child count


passing index, root and isNew?
a function that just creates, but doesn't attach?

what if the old vnode has same children as the new one
  if a tag gets replaced it's children have to be re-attached even if they don't change
    parentChanged param
      but it always changes in that case

^^ that's what pattern matching is good for

with tag
  none 
    create tag, assign props, attach
  text 
    create text, replace
  tag 
    different type
      create tag, assign props, replace
    different props
      assign props
with text
  none 
    create text, attach
  text 
    assign data
  tag 
    create text, attach
    replace


is replacing the child with itself fast?

just explicitly memoize what you wanna memoize?
  that has to use 1st level diffing
  that's components for ya
    but what about component results?
    what do they get matched with?
      you can store 'em in the vnode


imperative
  change this thing now
declarative
  here's how this thing should always be

There are 2 problems that vdom libraries are trying to solve:
  - imperative way clunky
  - declarative way slow (and breaks things)



it looks like a great thing to poorly automate
but working with the profiler api would probably be a pain in the ass
would have to use playwright or something

benchmark attaching flat off screen
and of attaching on-screen but to element different than body
and that of attaching bottom-up

but that would require a native support for pub-sub thingies
  rly? elm doesn't do that
    
is that element-level diffing just implementing a missing functionality of DOM API?
why is this a thing? browser doesn't do rendering right away anyway?
  so what the browser does, and what should it do?

why diffing is a thing
  because you don't call "render" normally
  because changing dom triggers re-rendering each time
    or rather it triggers a single re-render

when do elements differ
  different type and props
  what about keys and stuff?
  that's when elements get moved or something
  or an element appears between others
    should stuff like that be avoided in react/preact to make things faster?
  

queueeless way:
  diffing and updating in one call
  relies on the bottom-up attachment being faster
    rly?
    top-down attachment is more convenient
      why?
      but
        ddoesn't it require creating new elements to avoid spurious rendering in cases where the bottom up way would avoid it?
    attaching to the parent within a call doesn't mean top down, if the children stuff is done before it
      but is passing the parent a good idea anyway?
  if elements differ:
    diff the children
  stuff gets attached only if some element only differs by children

let's try the elmish way first
what gets diffed corresponds to a proper DOM tree
  model immutability doesn't seem to be required
    why would it be
      diffing props
    but only atomic props are assigned to the vnodes when there are no components


I don't know if the lispy editor thingy needs the speed from diffing tbh


so components can work by separating children and results
  the vnode tree is larger than the dom tree
  the "attachment node" can be passed down through multiple components

where do old vnodes go?

the weird problem that would be solved by lisp's quasiquote with spread
  that's for components and stuff, leave it for now

recursive flattening

so you want a thing that manages a part of dom to update it
but you might want to update only a small bit


I do stuff based on how I've seen it done
I start to repeat stuff a lot
I ask myself is it really necessary?
I start coming up with workarounds that achieve the same functionality
but they look ugly

why am I trying to write a vdom?
because I didn't know what I was doing 
...
I wanna know If I'm doing an actual workaround or just LARPng

why have components when you have only 2nd level diffing?
  for fragments?
    why not just use lists?

what if the two levels of diffing are combined?
  whaddyameen combined?
  a fustercluck?
  plenty o' trees

is stuff like absolute position in calculated style?
I was doing those benchmarks because I wanted to know what's actually slow

components in reactish frameworks
  their children and the results

web app is portable sandboxed program
web browser is an OS with a standard library for IO and rendering multimedia
meh...
another way - how it emerged
documents, scripting, other multimedia
vector graphics

then there are preact signals
isn't this whtat the browser should be doing anyway?

[move]
I don't like hideous code
It's different when ugly code is fundamentally easier to write

so diffing can occur on 2 levels
before calling components
before updating dom
preact doesn't seem to diff before updating components



So what am I trying to do anyway?
I'm trying to find out what takes so long?
Does anything take long?
Imagine somebody said "naah, it's all negligible, you can re-render the whole dom after each change and it would be OK"
Whatever dude, just do it the easiest way until it's slow


==================================================
;OLD

components returning multiple vnodes

attaching stuff lower down eliminates the need to concatenate arrays
  but isn't concatenating arrays cheaper?
    is attaching stuff lower down expensive?
      it should be AFAIK
      it shouldn't matter if the top-level node is detached AFAIK 

each component has a vnode
fragment is a component
fragment adds no dom nodes
not every vnode is bound to a dom node

handling children
  vnode -> just insert
  array -> insert a fragment
  other -> insert text
